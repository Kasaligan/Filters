     - axis: choose "1" for atributes in rows, "0" for atributes in columns
     - inplace: Boolean. False will return processed dataframe, True will overwrite base dataframe
     - show_percentages: shows the NaN percentages for each variable
     - show_erased_atributes: shows the erased atributes based on the NaN percentage threshold
