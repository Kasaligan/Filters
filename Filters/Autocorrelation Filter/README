The following method eliminates dataframe atributes based on a Pearson correlation (R) threshold which can be positive or negative.
If positive the method eliminates atributes with correlations above said threshold. If negative the method eliminates atributes with correlations below the threshold.
Atributes must be in COLUMNS.
Requires pandas library and numpy library as np.

Parameters description: 
     - df: base dataframe 
     - threshold: R threshold above or below (depending on sign + or -) which the method will filter atributes. Mustt be in range -1<=threshold<=1 
     - inplace: Boolean. False will return processed dataframe, True will overwrite base dataframe
     - show_correlations: shows the correlation matrix
     - show_erased_atributes: shows the erased atributes based on the NaN percentage threshold
