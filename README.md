# Filters

Here I save some filters ready for implementation for python datasets treatment. I've developed these for certain applications, some a little more specific than others, but you may find some other use or use them as a stepping stone for your own codes. If any other code was used as a base it will be properly acknowledged in the method description. The codes may have varying room for improvement (some even suggested in the proper code). Feel free to use any of these and contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.
