# Personal_methods

Here I save some methods I develope for certain applications, for which I see potential use in the future. Most of these are codes for tasks I haven't found after searching the web. If any other code is used as base or inspiration it will be properly acknowledged. The codes may have varying room for improvement.
Feel free to use any of these codes and contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.
